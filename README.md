DeepGazeIIIE (ACW) - Enhanced Visual Saliency Prediction
Welcome to the official repository for our implementation of the DeepGazeIIIE (ACW) model, an extension of the state-of-the-art DeepGazeIIIE architecture for visual saliency prediction. This repository contains all the necessary code, data processing scripts, and model configurations to reproduce the experiments described in our research.
